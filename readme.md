A browser extension that displays the country of origin of the current websiteâ€™s company.

## Building from source

The build process has been conceived to be platform-agnostic.
The commands listed below are for Linux, but should be trivial to
adapt for Windows. Not sure about MacOS, but I believe they should
be the same there too.

### For Firefox

- Install NodeJS (latest LTS)
- `npm i -g typescript rollup`
- `npm i`
- `rollup -c --minify` (--minify is optional, obviously)
- `rm -rf src/ts` (optional as well, but no point in bundling the TS files)
- `cp license.txt src/`
- `node utils/download_flags.js src/img/flags/`
- And now the `src` folder is ready to be zipped

### For Chrome/Chromium/Edge/Opera/Brave, etc.

Follow the Firefox steps, but before zipping, run this command
in order to convert the provided `manifest.json` to its Chrome version:
`node utils/convert_manifest.js src/manifest.json src/manifest.json`
